# HousingScore

This is something that I just want to mess around with because I haven't done any JavScript/web stuff in a long time. I'm no expert in this area so you probably don't want to use this as an example :)

I am currently looking to buyy a house and it is a serious pain in the butt. This is intended to be a tool that I can paste the link to the house I want to check out and have it generate a "Score" based on some criteria that I find important. That way I can filter out the houses in the area near me pretty easily.

## Getting Started

To run the web server use `docker-compose`. 

```
docker-compose up
```

will start a server on port 3000 on your machine. This is nice for dev :)
